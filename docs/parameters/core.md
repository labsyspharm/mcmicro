Core modules:
{: .fw-500}
{: .fs-7}
{: .text-blue-000}

{: .fs-3}
*All modules in MCMICRO are available as standalone executable Docker containers. When running modules within MCMICRO, the inputs and outputs will be handled by the pipeline and do not need to be specified explicitly.*

## BaSiC
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-yellow-100}
*Illumination correction*

### Description

The module implements the BaSiC method for correcting uneven illumination, developed externally by [(Peng et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14836){:target="_blank"}. The module doesn't have any additional parameters.

### Usage

By default, MCMICRO skips this step as it requires manual inspection of the outputs to ensure that illumination correction does not introduce artifacts for downstream processing.  Add `start-at: illumination` to [`workflow` parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow) to request that MCMICRO runs the module.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  start-at: illumination
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/labsyspharm/basic-illumination#running-as-a-docker-container){:target="_blank"}.

### Input
Unstitched images in any [BioFormats-compatible format](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html){:target="_blank"}. Nextflow will take these from the `raw/` subdirectory within the project.

### Output
Dark-field and flat-field profiles for each unstitched image. Nextflow will write these to the `illumination/` subdirectory within the project.

{: .fw-500}
{: .text-yellow-200}
*Stitching and registration*

### Description

The module performs simultaneous stiching of tiles and registration across channels. Check the [ASHLAR website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/ashlar){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage

MCMICRO runs ASHLAR by default. Add `ashlar:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to control its behavior.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
options:
  ashlar: --flip-y -c 5
```

* Default: `ashlar: -m 30`
* Running outside of MCMICRO: [ASHLAR website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/ashlar){:target="_blank"}.

### Input
* Unstitched images in any [BioFormats-compatible format](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/latest/supported-formats.html){:target="_blank"}. Nextflow will take these from the `raw/` subdirectory within the project.
* [Optional] Dark-field and flat-field profiles from illumination correction. Nextflow will take these from the `illumination/` subdirectory within the project.

### Output
A pyramidal, tiled `.ome.tif`. Nextflow will write the output file to `registration/` within the project directory.

## Coreograph
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-red-300}
*TMA core detection and dearraying*

### Description
The modules uses the popular UNet deep learning architecture to identify cores within a tissue microarray (TMA). After identifying the cores, it extracts each one into a separate image to enable parallel downstream processing of all cores.

### Usage

By default, MCMICRO assumes that the input is a whole-slide image. Add `tma: true` to [`workflow`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow#tma) to indicate that the input is a TMA instead. Add `coreograph:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to control the module behavior.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  tma: true
options:
  coreograph: --channel 3
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UNetCoreograph){:target="_blank"}.

### Input
A fluorescence image of a tissue microarray where at least one channel is of DNA (such as Hoechst or DAPI). Nextflow will take this from the `registration/` subfolder within the project.

### Output\*

1. Individual cores as `.tif` stacks with user-selectable channel ranges
2. Binary tissue masks (saved in the 'mask' subfolder)
3. A TMA map showing the labels and outlines of each core for quality control purposes<br>
4. A text file listing the centroids of each core in the format: Y, X

{: .fs-3}
\* Nextflow will write images and masks to the `dearray/` subfolder and the TMA map to the `qc/coreo/` subfolder within the project.

![map]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/coreograph1.png)<br>

### Optional arguments to Coreograph

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--downsampleFactor`  | Default is 5 times to match the training data |How many times to downsample the raw image file|
|`--channel` | | Which channel is fed into UNet to generate probability maps (usually DAPI) |
|`--buffer` | 2 | The extra space around a core before cropping it. A value of 2 means there is twice the width of the core added as buffer around it.|
 | `--outputChan` | |a range of channels to be exported. -1 is default and will export all channels (takes awhile). Select a single channel or a continuous range. ``--outputChan 0 10`` will export channel 0 up to and including channel 10 |
 | `--tissue` | | Coreograph will assume that its input is a whole-slide image and will work to isolate individual tissue chunks into separate files |

### Troubleshooting
A troubleshooting guide can be found within [Coreograph parameter tuning]({{site.baseurl}}/troubleshooting/tuning/coreograph.html).

## UnMICST
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-red-100}
*Image segmentation - probability map generation*

### Description

UnMICST uses a convolutional neural network to annotate each pixel with the probability that it belongs to a given subcellular component (nucleus, cytoplasm, cell boundary). Check the [UnMICST website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/UnMICST-info/){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
MCMICRO applies UnMicst to all input images by default. Add `unmicst:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to control its behavior.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
options:
  unmicst: --scalingFactor 0.5
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/UnMicst){:target="_blank"}.

### Input
An ``.ome.tif``, preferably flat field corrected. The model is trained on images acquired at a pixelsize of 0.65 microns/px. If your settings differ, you can upsample/downsample to some extent. Nextflow will use as input files from the `registration/` subdirectory for whole-slide images and from the `dearray/` subdirectory for tissue microarrays.

### Output \*
1. a ```.tif``` stack where the different probability maps for each class are concatenated in the Z-axis in the order: nuclei foreground, nuclei contours, and background.
2. a QC image with the DNA image concatenated with the nuclei contour probability map with suffix *Preview*

{: .fs-3}
\* Nextflow will write probability maps to the `probability-maps/unmicst/` subfolder and the previews to the `qc/unmicst/` subfolder within the project.

### Optional arguments to UnMicst

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--tool <version>` | `unmicst-solo` | UnMicst version: *unmicst-legacy* is the old single channel model. *unmicst-solo* uses DAPI. *unmicst-duo* uses DAPI and lamin. |
| `--model` | human nuclei from DAPI | The name of the UNet model. By default, this is the human nuclei model that identifies nuclei centers, nuclei contours, and background from a DAPI channel. Other models include mouse nuclei from DAPI, and cytoplasm from stains resembling WGA |
| `--channel <number>` | `1` | The channel used to infer and generate probability maps from. If using UnMicst2, then specify 2 channels. If only 1 channel is specified, it will simply be duplicated. **NOTE: If not using default value, the 1st channel must be specified to S3segmenter as --probMapChan in --s3seg-opts**|
| `--classOrder` | None | If your training data isn't in the order 1. background, 2. contours, 3. foreground, you can specify the order here. For example, if you had trained the class order backwards, specify `--classOrder 3 2 1`. If you only have background and contours, use `--classOrder 1 2 1`. |
| `--mean <value>` | Extracted from the model | Override the trained model's mean intensity. Useful if your images are significantly dimmer or brighter. |
| `--std <value>` | Extracted from the model | Override the trained model's standard deviation intensity. Useful if your images are significantly dimmer or brighter. |
| `--scalingFactor <value>` | `1` | An upsample or downsample factor used to resize the image. Useful when the pixel sizes of your image differ from the model (ie. 0.65 microns/pixel for human nuclei model) |
| `--stackOutput` | Specified | If selected, UnMicst will write all probability maps as a single multipage tiff file. Otherwise, UnMicst will write each class as a separate file. |
| `--GPU <index>` | Automatic | Explicitly specify which GPU (1-based indexing) you want to use. Useful for running on local workstations with multiple GPUs. |

### Troubleshooting
A troubleshooting guide can be found within [UnMICST parameter tuning]({{site.baseurl}}/troubleshooting/tuning/unmicst.html) - additional information is also available on the [UnMICST website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/UnMICST-info/){:target="_blank"} .

## S3segmenter
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-purple-000}
*Image segmentation - cell mask generation*

### Description

The modules applies standard watershed segmentation to probability maps to produce the final cell/nucleus/cytoplasm/etc. masks.

### Usage
By default, MCMICRO applies S3segmenter to the output of all modules that produce probability maps. Add `s3seg:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to control its behavior..

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
options:
  s3seg: --logSigma 2 10
```

### Inputs
1.  A fully-stitched and registered ``.ome.tif``, preferably flat field corrected. Nextflow will take these from the `registration/` and `dearray/` subdirectories, as approrpriate.
2.  A 3-class probability map, as derived by modules such as [UnMICST](./core.html#unmicst) or [Ilastik](./core.html#ilastik).

[S3segmenter](https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/S3segmenter){:target="_blank"} assumes that you have:
1. Acquired images of your sample with optimal acquisition settings.
2. Stitched and registered the tiles and channels respectively (if working with a large piece of tissue) and saved it as a Bioformats compatible tiff file.
3. Processed your image in some way so as to increase contrast between individual nuclei using classical or machine learning methods such as [Ilastik](./core.html#ilastik) (a random forest model) or [UnMICST](./core.html#unmicst) (a deep learning semantic segmentation model based on the UNet architecture). MCMICRO supports both.
{: .fs-3}

### Output
**1) 32-bit label masks for each compartment of the cell:**  

{: .fs-3}
  >* `nuclei.ome.tif` (nuclei) 
  >* `cytoplasm.ome.tif` (cytoplasm) 
  >* `cell.ome.tif` (whole cell)
  >* If only nuclei segmentation was carried out, `cell.ome.tif` is identical to `nuclei.ome.tif`

Nextflow saves these files to the `segmentation/` subfolder within your project.
 
**2) Two-channel quality control files with outlines overlaid on gray scale image of channel used for segmentation**  

{: .fs-3}
  >* `nucleiOutlines.tif` (nuclei),
  >* `cytoplasmOutlines.tif` (cytoplasm) 
  >* `cellOutlines.tif` (whole cell)
  >* If only nuclei segmentation was carried out, `cellOutlines.tif` is identical to `nucleiOutilnes.tif`

Nextflow saves these files to the `qc/s3seg/` subfolder within your project.

{: .fs-3}
**NOTE:** There are at least 2 ways to segment cytoplasm: i) using a watershed approach or ii) taking an annulus/ring around nuclei. Files generated using the annulus/ring method will have ‘Ring’ in the filename whereas files generated using watershed segmentation will not. It is important that these two groups of files are NOT combined and analyzed simultaneously as cell IDs will be different between them.

### Optional arguments to S3Segmenter

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--probMapChan <index>` | `1` | which channel is used for nuclei segmentation. **Coincides with the channel used in upstream semantic segmentation modules. Must specify when different from default.**  |
| `--crop <selection>` | `noCrop` | Type of cropping: `interactiveCrop` - a window will appear for user input to crop a smaller region of the image; `plate` - this is for small fields of view such as from a multiwell plate; `noCrop`, the default, is to use the entire image |

#### Nuclei parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--nucleiFilter <selection>` | `IntPM` | Method to filter false positive nuclei: `IntPM` - filter based on probability intensity; `Int` - filted based on raw image intensity |
| `--logSigma <value> <value>` | `3 60` | A range of nuclei diameters to search for. |

#### Cytoplasm parameters:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--segmentCytoplasm <selection>` | `ignoreCytoplasm` | Select whether to `segmentCytoplasm` or `ignoreCytoplasm` |
| `--CytoMaskChan <index>` | `2` | One or more channels to use for segmenting cytoplasm, specified as 1-based indices (e.g., `2` is the 2nd channel). |
| `--cytoMethod <selection>` | `distanceTransform` | The method to segment cytoplasm: `distanceTransform` - take the distance transform outwards from each nucleus and mask with the tissue mask; `ring` - take an annulus of a certain pixel size around the nucleus (see `cytoDilation`); `hybrid` - uses a combination of greyscale intensity and distance transform to more accurately approximate the extent of the cytoplasm. Similar to Cellprofiler's implementation. |
| `--cytoDilation <value>` | `5` | The number of pixels to expand from the nucleus to get the cytoplasm ring. |
| `--TissueMaskChan <index>` | Union of `probMapChan` and `CytoMaskChan` | One or more channels to use for identifying the general tissue area for masking purposes. |

## MCQuant
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-purple-200}
*Single-cell data quantification*


### Description
The modules uses one or more segmentation masks against the original image to quantify the expression of every channel on a per-cell basis. Check the [MCQuant README](https://github.com/labsyspharm/quantification#single-cell-quantification){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
By default, MCMICRO runs MCQuant on all cell segmentation masks that match the `cell*.tif` filename pattern. Add `mcquant:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to specify a different mask or to provide additional module-specific arguments to MCMICRO.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
options:
  mcquant: --masks cytoMask.tif nucleiMask.tif
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/labsyspharm/quantification){:target="_blank"}.

### Inputs

1. A fully stitched and registered image in `.ome.tif` format. Nextflow will use images in the `registration/` and `dearray/` subfolders as appropriate.
2. One or more segmentation masks in `.tif` format. Nextflow will use files in the `segmentation/` subfolder within the project.
3. A `.csv` file containing a `marker_name` column specifying names of individual channels. Nextflow will look for this file in the project directory.

### Output

A cell-by-feature table mapping Cell IDs to marker expression and morphological features (including x,y coordinates).

### Optional parameters for MCQuant

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--mask_props` | Space separated list of additional metrics to be calculated for every mask. This is intended for metrics that depend only on the cell mask. If the metric depends on signal intensity, use `--intensity-props` instead. See list at [https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops). |
| `--intensity_props` | Space separated list of additional metrics to be calculated for every marker separately. By default only mean intensity is calculated. If the metric doesn't depend on signal intensity, use `--mask-props` instead. See list at [https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#regionprops) Additionally available is gini_index, which calculates a single number between 0 and 1, representing how unequal the signal is distributed in each region. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient. For example, to calculate the median intensity, specify `--intensity_props median_intensity`.

## CyLinter
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-red-000}
*Quality control*

### Description
CyLinter is a human-in-the-loop quality control pipeline. It accepts as input the set of files generated by MCMICRO, including segmentation masks and single-cell feature tables, and returns a set of de-noised feature tables for use in downstream analyses.

### Usage
Because it requires human interactivity, CyLinter is not executed by MCMICRO directly. Instead, users are encourage to follow steps outlined on the [CyLinter website](https://labsyspharm.github.io/cylinter/){:target="_blank"} after applying MCMICRO to their data.

## SCIMAP
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-blue-100}

*Spatial analysis*


### Description
SCIMAP is a suite of tools that enables spatial single-cell analyses. Check the [SCIMAP website](https://scimap.xyz){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
MCMICRO allows users to automatically apply SCIMAP's clustering algorithms to the cell-by-feature table produced by MCQuant. The clustering results can be subsequently used for manual assignment of cell states. Since MCMICRO stops at MCQuant by default, users will need to explicitly request that the pipeline continues to the clustering step. MCMICRO's usage of SCIMAP doesn't have any parameters, and users are encouraged to check the [SCIMAP website](https://scimap.xyz){:target="_blank"} for more sophisticated human-in-the-loop analyses.

Add `downstream: scimap` and `stop-at: downstream` to [`workflow` parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow.html#stop-at) to enable SCIMAP. Add `mcquant:` to [`options`]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/#option-1-parameter-files-recommended) to control its behavior.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  stop-at: downstream
  downstream: scimap
options:
  scimap: --csv
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://scimap.xyz){:target="_blank"}.

### Input

A cell-by-feature table in `.csv` format, as produced by MCQuant. Nextflow will look for these tables in the `quantification/` subdirectory within the project.

### Output

1. A table of cluster assignments for each cell by the different clustering algorithms implemented within SCIMAP. These tables will be generated in `.csv` and `.h5ad` formats.
2. A set of UMAP plots for the different clustering algorithms, with individual plots written to the `plots/` subdirectory in `.pdf` format.

Nextflow will write all outputs to the `cell-states/scimap/` subdirectory within the project.

## Minerva
{: .fw-500}
{: .text-green-200}
*Interactive viewing and sharing*

### Description
Minerave allows for fast, interactive viewing of multiplexed images. It also enables highlighting and effective sharing of important regions of interest among collaborators.

### Usage
MCMICRO can automatically generate un-annotated Minerva stories if users enable the [`viz` workflow parameter](./workflow.html#viz).  

Annotated narratives must be manually generated, and users must provide MCMICRO outputs to Minerva in a separate workflow. To learn more about making Minerva stories, visit the [Minerva wiki](https://github.com/labsyspharm/minerva-story/wiki){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date information about the Minerva suite.

## Ilastik
{: .fw-500}

### Description
The module provides a command-line interface to the popular [ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/) toolkit and serves as another method for generating probability maps that can be used as an alternative to UnMICST. Check the [GitHub](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro-ilastik){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
By default, MCMICRO runs UnMicst for probability map generation. To run Ilastik instead of or in addition to UnMicst, add `segmentation: ilastik` to [workflow parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow#segmentation). When specifying multiple methods, the method names should be provided as a list enclosed in square brackets. Arguments should be passed to Ilastik via `ilastik:` in the module options section, while custom models can be provided to Ilastik via `ilastik-model:` workflow parameter.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  segmentation: [ilastik, unmicst]
  ilastik-model: /full/path/to/mymodel.ilp
options:
  ilastik: --nonzero_fraction 0.5 --num_channels 1
```
* Default ilastik options: `--num_channels 1`
* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro-ilastik){:target="_blank"}.

### Input
A stitched and registered ``.ome.tif``, preferably flat field corrected. Nextflow will use as input files from the `registration/` subdirectory for whole-slide images and from the `dearray/` subdirectory for tissue microarrays.

### Output
The output is similar to that produced by UnMicst, namely a ```.tif``` stack where the different probability maps for each class are concatenated in the Z-axis in the order: nuclei foreground, nuclei contours, and background. Nextflow will write output to the `probability-maps/ilastik/` subdirectory within the project folder.

### Optional arguments

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--nonzero_fraction <value>` |`None` | Indicates fraction of pixels per crop above global threshold to ensure tissue and not only background is selected |
| `--nuclei_index <index>` |`1` | Index of nuclei channel to use for nonzero_fraction argument |
| `--num_channels <value>` | `None`| Number of channels to export per image (Ex: 40 corresponds to a 40 channel ome.tif image) |
| `--channelIDs <indices>` |`None` | Integer indices specifying which channels to export (Ex: 1 2 4). **NOTE: You must specify a channel to use for filtering in S3segmenter as --probMapChan in --s3seg-opts**|
| `--ring_mask`| Omitted | Specify if you have a ring mask in the same directory to use for reducing size of hdf5 image |
| `--crop_amount <integer>`| `None`| Number of crops you would like to extract |

## Cypository
{: .fw-500}

### Description
Cypository is used to segment the cytoplasm of cells. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HMS-IDAC/Cypository#cypository---pytorch-mask-rcnn-for-cell-segmentation){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
Add `segmentation: cypository` to [workflow parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow.html#segmentation) to enable Cypository. In general, it would be uncommon to run Cypository alongside probability map generators for nuclei, but it can be done by specifying method names as a list enclosed in square brackets, e.g., `segmentation: [cypository, unmicst]`. Additional Cypository parameters should be provided to MCMICRO by including a `cypository:` field in the module options section.

* Example `params.yml`:
``` yaml
workflow:
  segmentation: cypository
options:
  cypository: --channel 5
```

* Default cypository options: `--model zeisscyto`

### Input
A stitched and registered ``.ome.tif``, preferably flat field corrected. Nextflow will use as input files from the `registration/` subdirectory for whole-slide images and from the `dearray/` subdirectory for tissue microarrays.

### Output
A `.tif` file that annotates individual pixels with the probability that they belong to the cytoplasm of a cell. Nextflow will write output to the `probability-maps/cypository/` subdirectory within the project folder.

### Optional arguments

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|``--model``|  | Currently only one model exists (zeisscyto)|
|``--channel``| | channel containing the cytoplasm stain. 0-based indexing. | 
|``--threshold``|  0.6  |A value between 0 and 1 to filter out false detections.|  
|``--overlap`` | |The image is split into overlapping tiles before cytoplasm detection. This parameter specifies the amount of overlap in pixels.|
|``--scalingFactor``| 1 (no resizing)  |Factor by which to increase/decrease image size by.| 
|``--GPU``|Default behavior is the first GPU card (0-based indexing).| If multiple GPUs are available, this specifies which GPU card to use.|

## Mesmer
{: .fw-500}

### Description
The [Mesmer](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-021-01094-0){:target="_blank"} module provides an alternative segmentation approach to UnMicst and ilastik. It is implemented and maintained by an external group. Check their [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-applications){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date information.

### Usage

Add `segmentation: mesmer` to [workflow parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow.html#segmentation) to enable Mesmer. When running together with UnMicst and/or ilastik, method names must be provided as a list enclosed in square brackets. Additional Mesmer parameters can be provided to MCMICRO by including a `mesmer:` field in the module options section.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  segmentation: mesmer
options:
  mesmer: --image-mpp 0.25
```
* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-applications){:target="_blank"}.

### Input

A stitched and registered ``.ome.tif``, preferably flat field corrected. Nextflow will use as input files from the `registration/` subdirectory for whole-slide images and from the `dearray/` subdirectory for tissue microarrays.

### Output

A segmentation mask, similar to the ones produced by S3segmenter. Nextflow will write these files directly to `segmentation/`.

### Optional arguments

| Name | Description | Default Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `--nuclear-channel` | The numerical index of the channel(s) from `nuclear-image` to select. If multiple values are passed, the channels will be summed. | `0` |
| `--compartment` | Predict nuclear or whole-cell segmentation. | `"whole-cell"` |
| `--image-mpp` | The resolution of the image in microns-per-pixel. A value of 0.5 corresponds to 20x zoom. | `0.5` |

## Naivestates
{: .fw-500}


### Description
`naivestates` is a label-free, cluster-free tool for inferring cell types from quantified marker expression data, based on known marker <-> cell type associations. Check the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/labsyspharm/naivestates){:target="_blank"} for the most up-to-date documentation.

### Usage
Add a `downstream:` field to [workflow parameters]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow.html#downstream) to select naivestates. When running alongside other cell state inference methods, such as SCIMAP, method names should be provided as a list enclosed in square brackets. Custom marker to cell type (mct) mapping can be provided to naivestates via the `naivestates-model:` workflow parameters, while additional arguments should be specified by including a `naivestates:` field in the module options section.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  stop-at: downstream
  downstream: naivestates
  naivestates-model: /full/path/to/mct.csv
options:
  naivestates: --log no
```
* Default naivestates options: `-p png`
* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/labsyspharm/mcmicro-ilastik){:target="_blank"}.

### Inputs

* A cell-by-feature table in `.csv` format, such as one produced by MCquant. Nextflow will look for such tables in the `quantification/` subfolder of the project directory.
* [Optional] A two-column `.csv` file providing a many-to-many mapping between markers and cell types/states. The columns must be named `Marker` and `State`.

### Outputs
* A `.csv` file providing probabilities that a marker is expressed for each cell-marker pair.
* If the mapping to cell types is provided, a second `.csv` file with probabilistic annotations of each cell with its type/state.
* A set of plots showing probability distributions and UMAP projections

Nextflow will write all outputs to the `cell-states/naivestates/` subdirectory within the project. If relevant, additional QC files will be written to `qc/naivestates`.

### Optional arguments

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|`--plots <off|pdf|png>` | `off` | Produces QC plots of individual marker fits and summary UMAP plots in .png or .pdf format. |
| `--id <name>` | `CellID` |Name of the column that contains cell IDs|
| `--log <yes|no|auto>` | `auto` |When a log<sub>10</sub> transformation should be applied prior to fitting the data. The tool will do this automatically if it detects large values. Use `--log no` to force the use of original, non-transformed values instead.|
|`--comb <hmean|gmean>` | `gmean`| Whether to use harmonic mean (`hmean`) or geometric mean (`gmean`) to combine probabilities of expression for individual markers.|
|`--sfx <suffix>` |automatically determined| A common suffix on the marker columns (e.g., `_cellMask` or `_nucleiMask`). The suffix will be removed in the output plots and tables to improve readability. Use `$` to force an empty suffix.|
| `--umap`|disabled| Include this flag to generate UMAP plots.|
|`--mct <filename>` | |The tool has a basic marker -> cell type (mct) mapping in `typemap.csv`. More sophisticated mct mappings can be defined by creating a `custom-map.csv` file with two columns: `Marker` and `State`. |

## Backsub
{: .fw-500}


### Description
`Backsub` is a background subtraction module for sequential IF images. It performs autofluorescence, pixel-level subtraction on large `.ome.tif` images primarily developed with the Lunaphore COMET platform outputs in mind.

### Usage
By default, MCMICRO assumes background subtraction should not be performed. Add `background: true` to [module options]({{site.baseurl}}/parameters/workflow.html#background) to indicate it should be.

* Example `params.yml`:

``` yaml
workflow:
  background: true
```

* Running outside of MCMICRO: [Instructions](https://github.com/SchapiroLabor/Background_subtraction){:target="_blank"}.

### Inputs

* Stitched and registered multi-cycle `.ome.tif`
* The `markers.csv` file must contain a `marker_name` column specifying channel markers. The `background` column indicates which channel should be subtracted and the value must match the marker name of the background channel. The `exposure` column with exposure times for respective channel acquisitions is also required. Additionally, the `remove` column can have "TRUE" values for channels which shouldn't be included in the output. An example `markers.csv` can be found [here](https://github.com/SchapiroLabor/Background_subtraction/blob/main/example/markers.csv).

### Outputs

* A pyramidal, tiled `.ome.tif`. Nextflow will write the output file to `background/` within the project directory.
* A modified `markers.csv` to match the background subtracted image.
