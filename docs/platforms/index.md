# Deploying MCMICRO

Docker containers allow for uniform pipeline execution across many compute environments. However, some environments require additional steps. Instructions for systems using Galaxy, AWS or the (HMS-specific) O2 Compute Cluster are detailed in the sub-pages. 

1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO in a [Galaxy environment](./galaxy/)
1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO on [Amazon Web Services](./run-AWS.html)
1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO on the [O2 Compute Cluster](./run-O2.html) (for users at **Harvard Medical School only**)
