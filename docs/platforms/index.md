# Deploying MCMICRO

For small images (on the order of a few GB, like the exemplar dataset), MCMICRO can be run on your local computer. For larger images, MCMICRO may need to be deployed on infrastructure with high resource capacity. MCMICRO uses Docker containers for uniform pipeline execution across many compute environments. However, some environments require additional steps. Instructions for systems using Galaxy, AWS or the (HMS-specific) O2 Compute Cluster are detailed in the sub-pages.

1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO in a [Galaxy environment](./galaxy/)
1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO on [Amazon Web Services](./run-AWS.html)
1. Instructions for deploying MCMICRO on the [O2 Compute Cluster](./run-O2.html) (for users at **Harvard Medical School only**)
