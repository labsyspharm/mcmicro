Although the stage positioning is rather robust in modern microscopes, further aligments of image tiles acquired within one cycle as well as across multiple cycles are still needed.\n\nWhen the tiles are stitched by relying on the microscope stage coordinates alone, with the red-green checkerboard pattern showing neighboring tiles, the stage movement errors are highly obvious in the yellow overlapping regions <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"#s=1#w=0#g=0#m=-1#a=-100_-100#v=2.1534_0.1881_0.7653#o=-100_-100_1_1#p=Q\" role=\"button\">üîç</a>\n\nThe errors are even more pronounced when three DNA channels from subsequent cycles are overlayed using their stage positions <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"#s=1#w=0#g=1#m=-1#a=-100_-100#v=2.1534_0.1881_0.7653#o=-100_-100_1_1#p=Q\" role=\"button\">üîç</a>\n\nThe first step in MCMICRO is to align the provided **raw image tiles (Level 1)** and correct uneven illuminations in each of the tiles.
