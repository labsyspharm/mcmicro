# Troubleshooting MCMICRO on O2

The following are common problems users encounter on O2. For more information, please review [the instructions for running MCMICRO on O2]({{ site.baseurl }}/troubleshooting/O2.html).

### I am getting `java: command not found`

Make sure Java is loaded by doing `module load java`

### I am getting `docker: command not found`

Be sure to include `-profile O2` if you are in the `lsp` group on O2 and `-profile O2ext` if you are not. Type `groups` to check if you are in the `lsp` group.

### I am getting `FATAL: singularity image is not in an allowed configured path`

Rerun `nextflow run labsyspharm/mcmicro/setup/O2ext.nf`
