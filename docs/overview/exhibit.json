Although the stage positioning is robust in modern microscopes, image tiles from identical and subsequent cycles still require further aligment. \n\nWhen tiles are stitched by relying on the microscope stage coordinates alone, stage movement errors are highly obvious in the yellow overlapping regions, with the red-green checkerboard pattern showing neighboring tiles. <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"#s=1#w=0#g=0#m=-1#a=-100_-100#v=2.1534_0.1881_0.7653#o=-100_-100_1_1#p=Q\" role=\"button\">🔍</a>\n\nThe errors are even more pronounced when three DNA channels from subsequent cycles are overlayed using their stage positions. <a class=\"btn btn-primary btn-sm\" href=\"#s=1#w=0#g=1#m=-1#a=-100_-100#v=2.1534_0.1881_0.7653#o=-100_-100_1_1#p=Q\" role=\"button\">🔍</a>\n\nThe first step in MCMICRO is to align the provided **raw image tiles (Level 1)** and correct uneven illuminations in each of the tiles.
